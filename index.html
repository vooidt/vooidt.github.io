        <p>I have an associate degree in software development. I attended at Rosemount High School, 
            but I also attended Dakota County Technical College at the same time. So I graduated highschool and community college at same semester.
            My hobbies is playing video games, especially soullikes/soulbornes, drawing sometimes, and hanging out with friends.
            My most preferred programming language is C#.
